# ObjectionKt
A Kotlin DSL for creating Ace Attorney scenes that can be uploaded to [Objection Maker](http://objection.lol/maker).

If you're able to run KotlinJVM, this is a more convenient way to create large Objection Maker projects, as you can use custom functions and variables to easily control many scenes from a single value.
